  Game story**: The game is set on a small farm on the edge of town. The journey from seed to fruit to the gardener's plate is not an easy one for our brave tomato who has to go from freezing winters in the solarium to summers out in the open where her life is always endangered by animals living underground and feeding on the freshly ripe fruit.

`	`**Game Overview:** The idea of the game is for a single player to help the tomato to go through the maze, depending on the season and a limited time in which to collect the other vegetables and not run into insects and pests that appear in its path. The last step the player must do before his vegetables and the tomato reach the gardener is to cut them perfectly to make a salad.

`	`**Game rules:** The game involves strategically choosing the path for our tomato to reach the gardener in time and gathering as many vegetables as possible along the way. The tomato and the other vegetables suffer from an encounter with an impostor so they are no longer fit to eat and the player loses. Even if the player manages to get through the maze, collect the required number of vegetables, but fails to cut them correctly before they make it into the salad or does not complete all the tasks in time he loses again.

`	`**Game characters:** 

\- The Brave Rose is the player-character. She is as her name says brave and eager to get with the other vegetables to the gardener to be eaten as soon as possible.

**Game board:**  

\- Passive components: grass, soil, flowers, walls and stones that prevent the tomato from walking on that space and that it must avoid

\- Active components: the mole and the insects that the tomato has to avoid so they will eat it, the other vegetables (cucumbers, radishes, onions, peppers, carrots) that the tomato has to collect for the salad and the knife that the player will use to cut.

\- The structure of the game board: depending on the season winter or summer when the ground will be covered with grass and flowers, all the components will be laid out on the whole game board. At the top of the board will be the player's life time and the number of vegetables collected from the number that is imposed to pass this task. There will also be a kitchen counter where at the end the player has to cut the vegetables to get into the salad bowl.

**Description of each level:** 

\- The first level will take place in winter, which is why our tomato will have fewer obstacles in its way, being in a greenhouse. The tomato's lifespan will be longer and the number of pests on the board will be reduced, being a much better protected space against them.

\- The second level with a higher degree of difficulty will take place in summer, outdoors where the number of pests increases, the life span of the tomato decreases due to the burning sun and pesticides.
